1.	We start a with data set with X and Y value (X – SMS and Y- Spam or Ham value)
2.	Do preprocessing 
3.	Do Feature Extraction
4.	Device data set into two potion (Traning – Have X and Y ) – Train and Test data- Split ratio 80 and 20
5.	Using Train data , Input to a ML model
6.	ML model –m Will Learn relation about X and Y
7.	And We gave only the X to ML model and Ask to predict What is Y.
8.	Model Predict some Y and We compare Y with the Actual Y
9.	How many of them are correct?
10.	Check both get Accuracy  = 75 %
